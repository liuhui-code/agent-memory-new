# Agent Memory Maintain

Use this skill for memory system health and maintenance.

## Initialize Or Repair

```bash
python tools/agent_memory.py init --project .
python tools/agent_memory.py doctor --project .
```

## Health Check

```bash
python tools/agent_memory.py doctor --project .
```

## Refresh Indexes

```bash
python tools/agent_memory.py wiki-index --project .
```

## Sync Obsidian Mirror

```bash
python tools/agent_memory.py vault-export --project .
python tools/agent_memory.py vault-index --project .
```

Rules:

- SQLite is the source of truth.
- Obsidian is a generated review mirror.
- Do not modify shell profiles.
- Report failed `doctor` checks exactly.
