## 2026-05-26 - Add MVP planning documents

Files changed:
- `agent.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/mvp-implementation-plan.md`
- `gitlog.md`

What changed:
- Reframed the project around Skill-driven Memory Runtime.
- Documented SQLite as the source of truth and Obsidian as a generated mirror.
- Added the detailed MVP implementation plan.
- Added repository instructions for future coding agents.
- Added this local development log.

Why:
- Establish a stable implementation target before writing runtime code.
- Preserve the decisions from the design discussion in project files.

Verification:
- Command: `rg --files`
- Expected: all new documentation files are present.

Rollback notes:
- Restore the previous `agent.md` from editor history if needed.
- Delete `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/mvp-implementation-plan.md`, and `gitlog.md` to return to the earlier minimal documentation state.

## 2026-05-26 - Implement MVP runtime, skills, and installer

Files changed:
- `.gitignore`
- `docs/mvp-implementation-plan.md`
- `tools/agent_memory.py`
- `install.py`
- `skills/agent-memory-init/SKILL.md`
- `skills/agent-memory-query/SKILL.md`
- `skills/agent-memory-update/SKILL.md`
- `skills/agent-memory-reflect/SKILL.md`
- `skills/agent-memory-wiki/SKILL.md`
- `skills/agent-memory-vault/SKILL.md`
- `references/schema.md`
- `references/skill-protocol.md`
- `references/obsidian-vault.md`
- `references/codebase-wiki.md`

What changed:
- Added the local Agent Memory runtime CLI.
- Added SQLite initialization, doctor checks, updates, search, context, reflection, vault export, and wiki indexing.
- Added six runtime-calling skills.
- Added an installer for project-local runtime and skill setup.
- Ignored generated runtime state and locally installed skills.
- Marked implementation plan checklist items complete after verification.

Why:
- Execute the documented MVP plan and make the project usable by local Agents through skills.

Verification:
- Command: `python3 tools/agent_memory.py init --project .`
- Result: initialized successfully.
- Command: `python3 tools/agent_memory.py doctor --project .`
- Result: all checks OK.
- Command: `python3 tools/agent_memory.py context --project . --query "如何对接本地 agent cli" --json`
- Result: returned the stored semantic fact.
- Command: `python3 tools/agent_memory.py vault-export --project .`
- Result: generated `.agent-memory/vault/index.md` and memory pages.
- Command: `python3 tools/agent_memory.py wiki-search --project . --query memory --json`
- Result: returned indexed files and symbols.

Rollback notes:
- Delete `.gitignore`, `tools/agent_memory.py`, `install.py`, `skills/`, `references/`, and generated `.agent-memory/` / `.agent-skills/` directories if reverting the runtime implementation.
