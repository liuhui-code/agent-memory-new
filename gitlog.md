## 2026-05-26 - Add MVP planning documents

Files changed:
- `agent.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/mvp-implementation-plan.md`
- `gitlog.md`

What changed:
- Reframed the project around Skill-driven Memory Runtime.
- Documented SQLite as the source of truth and Obsidian as a generated mirror.
- Added the detailed MVP implementation plan.
- Added repository instructions for future coding agents.
- Added this local development log.

Why:
- Establish a stable implementation target before writing runtime code.
- Preserve the decisions from the design discussion in project files.

Verification:
- Command: `rg --files`
- Expected: all new documentation files are present.

Rollback notes:
- Restore the previous `agent.md` from editor history if needed.
- Delete `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/mvp-implementation-plan.md`, and `gitlog.md` to return to the earlier minimal documentation state.

## 2026-05-26 - Implement MVP runtime, skills, and installer

Files changed:
- `.gitignore`
- `docs/mvp-implementation-plan.md`
- `tools/agent_memory.py`
- `install.py`
- `skills/agent-memory-init/SKILL.md`
- `skills/agent-memory-query/SKILL.md`
- `skills/agent-memory-update/SKILL.md`
- `skills/agent-memory-reflect/SKILL.md`
- `skills/agent-memory-wiki/SKILL.md`
- `skills/agent-memory-vault/SKILL.md`
- `references/schema.md`
- `references/skill-protocol.md`
- `references/obsidian-vault.md`
- `references/codebase-wiki.md`

What changed:
- Added the local Agent Memory runtime CLI.
- Added SQLite initialization, doctor checks, updates, search, context, reflection, vault export, and wiki indexing.
- Added six runtime-calling skills.
- Added an installer for project-local runtime and skill setup.
- Ignored generated runtime state and locally installed skills.
- Marked implementation plan checklist items complete after verification.

Why:
- Execute the documented MVP plan and make the project usable by local Agents through skills.

Verification:
- Command: `python3 tools/agent_memory.py init --project .`
- Result: initialized successfully.
- Command: `python3 tools/agent_memory.py doctor --project .`
- Result: all checks OK.
- Command: `python3 tools/agent_memory.py context --project . --query "如何对接本地 agent cli" --json`
- Result: returned the stored semantic fact.
- Command: `python3 tools/agent_memory.py vault-export --project .`
- Result: generated `.agent-memory/vault/index.md` and memory pages.
- Command: `python3 tools/agent_memory.py wiki-search --project . --query memory --json`
- Result: returned indexed files and symbols.

Rollback notes:
- Delete `.gitignore`, `tools/agent_memory.py`, `install.py`, `skills/`, `references/`, and generated `.agent-memory/` / `.agent-skills/` directories if reverting the runtime implementation.

## 2026-05-26 - Add skill-first usage guidance

Files changed:
- `docs/usage-guide.md`
- `README.md`
- `agent.md`
- `skills/agent-memory-wiki/SKILL.md`
- `gitlog.md`

What changed:
- Added user-facing guidance that normal use should start with natural language and skills.
- Documented current wiki usage and the planned `learn-entry` / `learn-path` direction for partial project memory.
- Updated project docs to preserve the design rule: LLM invokes skills, skills invoke deterministic runtime commands.

Why:
- Improve usability and lower the command memorization burden for users.

Verification:
- Command: `python3 tools/agent_memory.py doctor --project .`
- Expected: all checks OK.

Rollback notes:
- Remove `docs/usage-guide.md` and revert the README, agent, skill, and gitlog edits from this entry.

## 2026-05-26 - Simplify to four skills and add local learning commands

Files changed:
- `tools/agent_memory.py`
- `skills/agent-memory-learn/SKILL.md`
- `skills/agent-memory-maintain/SKILL.md`
- `skills/agent-memory-query/SKILL.md`
- `skills/agent-memory-reflect/SKILL.md`
- `README.md`
- `agent.md`
- `docs/usage-guide.md`
- `docs/mvp-implementation-plan.md`
- `gitlog.md`

What changed:
- Collapsed user-facing skills into Learn, Query, Maintain, and Reflect.
- Added `learn-entry` for entry-file-based local memory indexing.
- Added `learn-path` for directory-based local memory indexing.
- Updated usage docs so natural language maps to the four skills.

Why:
- Lower the user-facing skill count and make partial project memory easier to use.

Verification:
- Command: `python3 tools/agent_memory.py learn-entry --project . --entry tools/agent_memory.py --depth 1 --json`
- Expected: indexes the entry file and writes `last_learn_entry.json`.
- Command: `python3 tools/agent_memory.py learn-path --project . --path skills`
- Expected: indexes skill files and writes a learning episode.

Rollback notes:
- Revert `tools/agent_memory.py` parser and learning helpers.
- Restore removed skill directories if returning to the previous six-skill model.

## 2026-05-26 - Add recursive memory query integration templates

Files changed:
- `docs/templates/diagnosis-memory-query-template.md`
- `docs/templates/change-design-memory-query-template.md`
- `skills/agent-memory-query/SKILL.md`
- `docs/usage-guide.md`
- `README.md`
- `gitlog.md`

What changed:
- Added a recursive memory-query template for bug diagnosis skills.
- Added a recursive memory-query template for design/change planning skills.
- Kept `agent-memory-query` small and pointed complex workflows to reusable templates.

Why:
- Support recursive memory interaction without turning the query skill into a complex diagnosis or design skill.

Verification:
- Command: `python3 tools/agent_memory.py doctor --project .`
- Expected: all checks OK.

Rollback notes:
- Delete `docs/templates/` and revert the query skill, usage guide, README, and gitlog edits from this entry.
